To do:

- fix loading functions (have all the weather arrays load at the beginning and only reset from there)
- add color transitions for background and ground
- why aren't my shadows appearing??
- should I be concerned about my synchronous call warnings?
- how do I get it to update every 10 minutes?
	//set timeout on 10000, everlasting timeout
	//wrap AJAX code in easily 
- should I have used Backbone??
